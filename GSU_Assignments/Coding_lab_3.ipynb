        "Mean - Mean represents the average of a group of numbers. One can understand the average value of a dataset by looking at the mean. However, means sometimes are biased, like when data is skewed or has outliers, so the mean may not reflect its group as well as it could.\n",
        "\n",

        "Variance - It is the Sd squared. It was done to make the standard deviations positive, since all regular numbers squared are positive. Variance hepls determine the degree of spread in a data set, and how individual numbers relate to one another. Due to all the deviations now being positive, they are now treated similarly to the positive deviations, thus making it more easier and less complicated to do problems.\n"
